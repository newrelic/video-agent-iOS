# New Relic Video Agent for iOS & tvOS

The New Relic Video Agent for iOS & tvOS contains multiple modules necessary to instrument video players and send data to New Relic.

## Modules

There are three modules available:

### NewRelicVideoCore

Contains all the base classes necessary to create trackers and send data to New Relic. It depends on the New Relic Agent.

### NRAVPlayerTracker

The video tracker for AVPlayer player. It depends on NewRelicVideoCore.

### NRIMATracker

The video tracker for Google IMA Ads library. It depends on NewRelicVideoCore.

## Installation

Download the latest pre-built XCFrameworks from the [Releases](https://github.com/newrelic/video-agent-iOS/releases/latest) page. Look for `XCFrameworks.zip`, extract it, and drag the `.xcframework` files into your Xcode project under **Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**, set to **"Embed & Sign"**.

For other installation methods including CocoaPods and manual builds, see [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md).

## Getting Started

For comprehensive setup instructions, usage examples, and best practices, see the [Developer Onboarding Guide](ONBOARDING.md).

The onboarding guide covers:
- Complete installation and setup
- AppDelegate configuration with automatic optimization
- Video player integration (with and without ads)
- Advanced configuration options
- Performance tuning and battery optimization
- Troubleshooting and best practices

## Quick Usage Example

To start the video agent with AVPlayer tracker only:

<details>
<summary>Objective-C</summary>
<p>

```Objective-C
// In AppDelegate - Initialize the video agent
NRVAVideoConfiguration *config = [[[NRVAVideoConfiguration builder]
    withApplicationToken:@"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_TOKEN"]
    withDebugLogging:YES]
    build];
[[[NRVAVideo newBuilder] withConfiguration:config] build];

// In your ViewController - Add player tracking
NRVAVideoPlayerConfiguration *playerConfig = [[NRVAVideoPlayerConfiguration alloc]
    initWithPlayerName:@"MainVideoPlayer"
    player:yourAVPlayer
    adEnabled:NO
    customAttributes:@{@"videoTitle": @"Sample Video"}];
NSInteger trackerId = [NRVAVideo addPlayer:playerConfig];
```

</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Swift</summary>
<p>

```Swift
// In AppDelegate - Initialize the video agent
let config = NRVAVideoConfiguration.builder()
    .withApplicationToken("YOUR_NEW_RELIC_TOKEN")
    .withDebugLogging(true)
    .build()
NRVAVideo.newBuilder().with(configuration: config).build()

// In your ViewController - Add player tracking
let playerConfig = NRVAVideoPlayerConfiguration(
    playerName: "MainVideoPlayer",
    player: yourAVPlayer,
    adEnabled: false,
    customAttributes: ["videoTitle": "Sample Video"]
)
let trackerId = NRVAVideo.addPlayer(playerConfig)
```

For complete integration examples including ad support, see the [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md) guide.

## Documentation

To generate source code documentation, you can use [appledoc](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc) as follows:

```bash
appledoc --project-name NewRelicVideoAgent --project-company "New Relic Inc." --company-id com.newrelic --create-html --no-create-docset --output ./docs NewRelicVideoCore/NewRelicVideoCore/**/*.h
```

And then open `docs/html/index.html` with your prefered browser.

The source code annotations are compatible with Doxygen, so you would rather use it if you prefer.

For more detail on the Events and Data Model generated by Video Agent for Android and for advanced concepts such as creating custom trackers, reference the [Advanced Topics](advanced.md) manual.
